# cryptoGo
Catalog of cryptography golang code samples for various cryptographic algorithms applications.

---
## Block Encryption (AES, AES-GCM)
 - [CFB Mode AES encryption](/blockEncryption/cfbBlockCipher.go) - Encrypt a file using AES encryption. 
 - [Authenticated Cipher Block Encryption](/blockEncryption/authenticatedBlockCipher.go) - AES-GCM Encryption of a file.

## Hashing (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
 -  [Hashcode](/hashcode/hashGenerator.go) - Generate Hashcode for a text file.

## Keyed Hashing - Message Authentication Code (MAC)
 -  [Hash based MAC (HMAC)](/mac/hmacGenerator.go) - Keyed hashing with selected hashing algorithm .
 -  [Cipher Based MAC (CMAC)](/mac/cmacGenerator.go) - Cipher based hashing.
